Can't build configs for root component 'placeholderToBadInclude[dev]'.
Exception in
	../components/exceptions/placeholderToBad/placeholderToBadInclude/application.yaml:1'
	key=${badInclude@key}
Can't resolve ${badInclude@key}
Cause: Component 'missing' doesn't exist. Dependency chain: badInclude -> missing
